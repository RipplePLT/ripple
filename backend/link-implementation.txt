=== LINK IMPLEMENTATION ===

 - Every symbol table entry has an is_referenced member boolean

 - When a referenced value is updated, we add a struct containing the
	new value and its address to a global queue

 - Maintain a hash map of references
 	* Referenced address as key
	* List of Linked_Var*s as value (i.e. references)

 - Upon receiving a condition signal, the worker thread recursively
	calls the update() functions of all Linked_Vars which
	reference the updated variable.
